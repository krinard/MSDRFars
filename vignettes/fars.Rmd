This package provides functions for understanding traffic accident patterns using data from the National Highway Safety institute.  Test data for years 2012, 2013 and 2014 is provided with this package.

For example, you can summarize the data file for a year or set of years, and see accidents rolled up by month and year:

```
accident_summary <- fars_summarize_years(c("2013","2015"))
head(accident_summary)
```
This package also provides functionality to allow you to plot accidents on a map, for a given state and year:

```
fars_map_state(1, "2013")
```
